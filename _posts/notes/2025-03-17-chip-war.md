# Summary

- semiconductor chips can be broadly classified into the following categories
	- DRAM, which are temporary storage
	- NAND, which are persistent storage
	- Logic Chips, which can be used for both CPU for general purpose sequential execution or GPU for simple operations parallel execution
	- Specialised Chips, like IR transceiver etc.
- performance benchmark for semiconductor chips
	- the smaller a transistor node, the more nodes can be fit on a chip
	- the more heat efficient the chip will be
	- the cutting edge is currently 2nm node (with 1.6 nm fabs under construction now)
- the current state of semiconductor production is a tightly knitted international web of supply chain dependencies
- in the beginning, US companies may have innovated chip fabrication, photolitography, but they lost market share over time after an initial period of dominance
	- companies started offshoring their assembly and even fabrication for lower cost
	- new companies enter the market that only specialize in chip design, no fabrication
	- the emerging fabrication companies in Asia only specialise in fab, achieving economies of scale and lower cost
	- equipment companies heavily researched on cutting edge fabrication technology and achieve global dominance in photolitography
- the lesson learnt: only by globalising the business, can any companies achieve an economy of scale to make newer technologies commercialisable
	- Russian semiconductor industry only depended on military contracts during the Cold War and lost in the innovation race
	- Intel invested on vertical capabilities (chip design and in-house foundry) but didn't pay off as it could not achieve fabrication economic of scales for smaller semiconductor nodes
	- Chinese provincial government invested in semiconductor industry at a local scale, and all projects failed to produce any results
	- EOS have benefited both equipment manufacturing and fabrication. It doesn't affect chip designing, since chip design is not capital intensive.

# Supply Chain and Integration

- the fabrication tools and machines are supplied by a few dominating companies
	- ASML from Netherlands, cutting edge photolitography machines. Other competitors are Canon, Nikon from Japan, Microtek from Germany
	- Applied Materials from USA, supplies other tools for chip manufacturing
	- and some others, can be googled
- the fabrication is dominated by a few players
	- TSMC from Taiwan, has a largest market share for logic chip production. It achieves economic of scale and has the capabilities to produce the smallest nodes in the world.
	- Samsung from South Korea has the second largest market share. Followed by Intel and GlobalFoundries from USA.
	- a couple of notable players
		- SK Hynix from South Korea. South Korea companies also dominates DRAM and NAND production. 
		- SMIC from China, heavily subsidized by the state
		- MIcron and Broadcom from America
- chip design has low barrier to entry since it is not capital intensive
	- Google design their own Tensorflow TPU for their GCP compute instances
	- Apple design their own Apple Silicon chips
	- AWS design their own Graviton processors
	- Nvidia with the leading GPU design
- given the nature of the semiconductor industry, which is only commercialisable at a global scale, any war or natural disaster that disrupt the production supply chain will be devastating to the global economy

# Notable computer architecture

- x86 is the legacy design that Intel used to dominate the market
- ARM is created by Arm Limited from UK
- RISC-V, is an open-source, RISC based architecture
