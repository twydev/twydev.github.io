# Introduction

- fast deaths are acute injuries and infections for example
- slow deaths are chronic diseases
- Modern medicine (Medicine 2.0) focuses on treating fast deaths and reacting to slow deaths after diseases manifest
	- Medicine 2.0 follows benchmark for health indicators to prescribe treatments
	- but individuals are different and conditions may not manifest
	- it may also be too late to stop chronic diseases
	- inaction may end up causing more harm
- Medicine 3.0 (proposed by the author) emphasises proactive prevention of slow deaths
- The Four Horsemen of slow deaths
	- Type 2 Diabetes and metabolic dysfunction
	- Heart disease (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ASCVD)
	- Cancer
	- Neurodegenerative Disease
- Healthspan, not just lifespan, is the focus. To live better (quality) for longer, maintaining physical and cognitive function.

# The Four Horsemen

- genetics definitely play a part and increase our inherent risk
- but a lot of risk also comes from our diet and lifestyle
- after learning about the four horsemen, it seems like eating too much coupled with lack of exercise is really a core problem to most diseases.

## Type 2 Diabetes / Metabolic Dysfunction

- metabolic dysfunction is the core as it is highly correlated to most chronic diseases
- it boils down to eating too much glucose
- when there is too much glucose in your blood, it will be converted to fats
- the next symptom is visceral fats (fat around the organs)
- Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease NAFLD is highly correlated with obesity and hyperlipidemia (excessive cholesterol)
	- liver turns fatty when it needs to store excess glucose in the blood as fats, and more fats enters than exits the liver
	- the next stage of the disease is Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis NASH, which is fatty and inflamed liver like hepatitis
- NAFLD and NASH are reversible, as the liver is a very resilient, almost miracle organ. Most common approach is to fight obesity.
- a note on fructose, they are metabolised differently from glucose and will take a shortcut to be stored as fats in our liver
	- so drinking large quantity of liquid fructose (found in all our syrups and drinks) is bad
- insulin resistance is the next symptom to surface after fatty organs
	- when too much glucose is in the blood, the pancreas need to produce more insulin
	- insulin is a hormone to signal to cells to absorb sugar from the blood
	- the cells build resistance to insulin, becoming a vicious cycle where more insulin is required to regulate glucose level
	- eventually, the pancreas becomes overworked, leading to diabetes

## Heart Disease

- lipoproteins, are part protein and part lipid molecules. The protein is responsible for transporting the lipid part in our blood around the body, because lipid are not water-soluble.
	- Low-density lipoprotein LDL is commonly known as the "bad cholesterol"
	- High-density lipoprotein HDL is commonly known as the "good cholesterol"
	- but technically there is no difference between the lipid carried by both proteins.
	- so objectively speaking lipids are not bad for your body, they are essential for our body to function
	- LDL tends to get stuck in our blood vessels due to its molecular structure (it can also oxidise and react with other molecules to cause blockages)
	- which is why LDL is correlated with higher risk of heart diseases
	- the LDL protein part is called apolipoprotein B (apoB), and to be more specific, this is the protein signature that causes problem
- there is insufficient evidence to correlate cholesterol ingested in our diet with the cholesterol circulating in our body
	- most of the cholesterol in our blood is produced by our own body
- metabolic dysfunction, when insulin resistance has occurred, causes liver to produce more LDL
	- it also interferes with production of HDL, lowering HDL level
	- insulin resistance also interferes with cholesterol absorption, which stimulate production of more LDL
	- therefore fixing metabolic problems, by improving diet and lifestyle, can also lower LDL

## Cancer

- cancer is a disease of aging, and it becomes more prevalent as we age
- cancer is hard to detect, and it is hard to treat. every cancer is different
- cancer cells don't grow faster than normal cells, their main problem is they don't stop growing
	- a gene called PTEN mutated and no longer signals to the cell to stop growing
- cancer is also a problem because of metastasis, which spreads the cancer to other parts of the body
- cancer metabolism is slightly different from normal cells
	- normal aerobic cellular respiration converts glucose to many ATP, yielding energy for the cells
	- the Warburg effect or anaerobic glycolysis, where cancer cells consume a lot of glucose but only produce a small amount of ATP and a lot of chemical by-products
	- almost as if producing energy is a by-product, and those chemical outputs are the main objective
	- finding sites with high glucose concentrations indicate possible presence of tumours
	- those chemical products are useful building blocks to create new cells, promoting cancer cells to proliferate
- therefore, again this links to too much glucose in the blood, and obesity is also strongly correlated with cancer
- while we cannot prevent genetic mutations causing cancer, we can prevent too much glucose from providing a hotbed for cancer to thrive
- immunotherapy is a promising and emerging field for treating cancer
- early detection is key, therefore the author recommends getting tested once in a while even when you feel perfectly healthy

## Neurodegenerative Diseases

- Alzheimer's disease is caused by a handful of mutation in some specific genes that promotes accumulation of certain protein in the brain
	- although there are also reports that shows that patients without build up of those proteins (like Amyloid-beta) also exhibits symptoms of the disease
	- detection is usually too late, and modern medicine has not been able to cure this disease
	- the same can be said for other diseases like Parkinson's (which affects movements)
- one way to slow the damage
	- building cognitive reserves (brain's capacity to perform) by doing new stimulating tasks
	- building movement reserves (the body's capacity to perform) by exercising
- the brain metabolise glucose differently by absorbing glucose directly from the blood, without insulin signals
	- this ensures the brain is a top priority to function in our body
	- insulin resistance, and prolonged period of high blood glucose level, will damage the brain (mechanistically)
	- hippocampus has high concentration of insulin receptors, and high insulin level is affecting memory functions
- deep sleep is like a garbage collection process
	- poor or disrupted sleep increases risk of dementia
	- accompanied by high stress and elevated cortisol levels, it multiplies the risk
	- hypercortisolemia (excess cortisol due to stress) inhibits release of melatonin, which makes sleep more difficult
- some other approaches that can help
	- surprisingly, oral and gum health is related to inflammatory markers, which seems to correlate with the disease
	- therefore, brush and floss regularly
	- regular saunas (4 x 20min sessions, 82 degree Celsius) seems to also help reduce risk
	- intake of vitamin B and omega-3 fatty acid also seems to help
- strategy in summary
	- what is good for the heart is also good for the brain (vascular health)
	- what is good for the liver is also good for the brain (metabolic health)
	- time is key, start early
	- most powerful prevention is exercise

# Framework and Tactics

## Exercise

- therefore four pillars to take note of

### Aerobic Efficiency: Zone 2

- long, steady-state cardio for mitochondrial health and fat oxidation
- approximately 70-85 percent of peak heart rate
- the talk test - the exercise is working you hard, but you are still able to talk and complete a sentence
- zone 2 output is highly variable and based on individual fitness
- about 3 hours per week (4x 45 mins sessions)
- measure the watts we produce per kg of our mass to track our zone 2 progression
	- 2 watts/kg, for a reasonably fit person
	- 3 watts/kg, very fit
	- 4 watts/kg, professional athletes

### Maximum Aerobic Output: VO2 Max

- Interval training for cardiovascular fitness and longevity
- Longer intervals than HIIT, ranging from 3-8 minutes
	- e.g. 4 mins high effort, 4 mins jogging pace, 6 reps

### Strength

- building and maintaining muscle mass
- this is crucial to prevent muscle loss that comes from aging, and also help maintain body functions
- we lose muscle faster as we get older
- bone density also improves when we perform high load-bearing activity
	- bones respond to mechanical tension 
	- estrogen is the key hormone in mediating the mechanical signal (weight-bearing) to a chemical one, telling the body to lay more bones
- actions to focus on, which helps with movements at older age
	- grip strength
	- concentric (muscle shortening) and eccentric (muscle lengthening) loading for all movements.
		- this allows us to lift weights up and put them back down, steadily with control.
		- eccentric strength in our quads is what allows us to move down hill safely without injuring our knees
	- pulling motions
	- hip-hinging movements

### Stability

- as we age, our muscle loss accelerates. if we are injured and that disrupts our training routine, it will snowball our decline
- therefore, not injuring ourselves is important
- proper breathing
- proper forms during training
- mobility trainings

## Nutrition

- the key questions to answer before we solve our problems are
	- are we under-nourished or over-nourished
	- are we under-muscled or adequately muscled
	- are we metabolically healthy or not
- depending on our current state, some diets may or may not suit us

### Categories of Diet

- Caloric Restriction CR
	- make sure we take in fewer calories without compromising on nutrients
	- it is challenging as we need to measure our intakes and fight the hunger to not snack or cheat
- Dietary Restriction DR
	- avoid intake of specific type of food
	- this only works if it also results in CR
	- perhaps because your main problem is consuming too much soda, and you are cutting it for example
	- so it is specific to individual needs, and not all diet will work for everyone if it doesn't address the specific problem
- Time Restriction TR
	- also called intermittent fasting
	- this cuts calories as it limits the time we eat
	- but a common downside is we end up protein deficient
	- it will be worst if a person ends up losing weight because of muscle loss
	- but it may be necessary to use fasting to perform a metabolic reboot in extreme cases

### Macronutrients

- alcohol
	- there is no health benefit to alcohol.
- carbohydrates
	- it is the primary source of energy
	- but overconsumption causes increased blood glucose level, which is bad
	- continuous glucose monitoring CGM can be a useful tool, even for healthy people, to monitor changes in glucose levels as we go about our daily lives
- lessons from CGM
	- refined carbs causes faster and higher glucose spike.
	- less processed carbs (contains more fibre), blunt the glucose impact. recommend 50g of fibre a day? (that's a lot)
	- rice and oatmeal are surprisingly glycemic (cause sharp rise in glucose level)
	- brown rice is only slightly less glycemic than long-grain white rice
	- fructose does not get measured by GCM
	- timing, duration, intensity of exercise affects glucose level
		- aerobic exercise is most efficacious at removing glucose from circulation
		- high-intensity exercise and strength training tend to increase glucose transiently
	- bad night sleep or less sleep causes a jump in peak glucose response and overall levels
	- stress, via cortisol and other stress hormones, impact glucose level even while fasting or having CR.
		- it is difficult to quantify, but it is most obvious during sleep or periods long after meal, when the body releases more glucose into circulation
	- non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, spinach) have virtually no impact on blood sugar
	- foods high in protein and fat (eggs, beef short ribs) have no effect on blood sugar
	- but large quantity of lean protein (chicken breast) elevates glucose level slightly.
	- protein shakes, especially if low in fat, have a more pronounce effect on elevating glucose level
	- stacking all above effects in positive or negative directions, can be powerful
	- tracking our own behaviour using CGM may create its own Hawthorne effect, which compels us to change our behaviour
- protein
	- recommended amount 1.6g protein per kg body mass per day for maintenance
	- for active people, can consume up to 2.2g per kg
	- it can be a lot of protein, so recommended to split into 4 servings a day
	- no need to worry about consuming too much
	- the most important macronutrients
- fats
	- it has a bad rap of leading to higher cholesterol
	- fats are important to maintain metabolic balance and brain health
	- eating fats makes us feel more satiated than eating carbs
	- all food always contains all groups of fats, saturated fatty acid SFA, monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA, and polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA.
		- PUFA can be separated into omega-6 and omega-3 variants
		- omega-3 can be subdivided in to marine (EPA, DHA) and non-marine (ALA) sources.
		- marine sources e.g. are salmon and seafood
		- non-marine sources e.g. are flaxseeds and nuts
	- some food like olive oil contains more MUFA, but it still contains other fat groups
	- recommended fats consumption
		- boost MUFA consumption to 50-55% of total fats
		- SFA cut down to 15-20%
		- make up the remaining with PUFA
	- in practice
		- eat more olive oil, avocado, nuts
		- cut back on butter and lard
		- reduce omega-6 rich oil like corn, soybean, sunflower oil
		- increase high omega-3 marine PUFAs from seafood (almost always requires supplement for EPA and DHA)

### Best Diet

- it is the one you can sustain
- aim to lower calorie intake
- increase protein intake and build muscle mass
- control lipid levels
- while also reducing blood glucose level

## Sleep

- poor sleep affects metabolic health, cognitive function, immune system, and emotional well-being

### How to improve sleep

- don't drink alcohol
- don't eat anything less than 3 hours before bedtime (ideally longer). it is ok to sleep with just a little bit of hunger
- abstain from stimulating electronic, beginning two hours before bed
- at least one hour before bed (if not, more) avoid doing anything anxiety-producing or stimulating
- hot shower or sauna or hot tub prior to bed. hitting a cool bed and lowering body temperature signals your brain the time to sleep
- room should be cool. cool mattress can help. mid-60s F (or 17-19 C)
- darken room completely. eye shade can help.
- provide ample time to prepare for bed
- fix wake-up time, even on weekend
- don't obsess over our sleep. clock-watching makes it harder to fall asleep. anxiety over our sleep metrics also affects our sleep.

## Emotional Health

- seek help from therapist
- we might be struggling with some trauma that we are not aware of
- it affects our relationships with others
- we can be fit and healthy mechanically, but having miserable relationships with those around us, which contradicts our focus on healthspan
